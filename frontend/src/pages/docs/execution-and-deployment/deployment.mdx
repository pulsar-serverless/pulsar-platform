Navigate to the "Projects" section and select your project.
Click on the "Upload Files" button.
Drag and drop your application files or browse to select them from your computer.
Click "Upload" to start the process.

### Using the CLI

Install the CLI tool by following the instructions in our documentation.
Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
Run the command `pulsar deploy` to upload your files.
Follow the prompts to complete the upload process.

## Step 2: Configure Deployment Settings

Customize your deployment settings, including environment variables, build configurations, and runtime options, to ensure your application runs smoothly.

### Environment Variables

Go to the "Environment Variables" section under your project settings.
Click "Add Variable" and enter the key and value for each variable.
Save the changes.

Adjust any additional settings as required.
Save the changes.

## Step 3: Initiate Deployment

With a single click or command, deploy your application to our serverless infrastructure. Our system handles the rest, from code build to deployment on a highly scalable and reliable environment.

### Using the Dashboard

After uploading your files and configuring the settings, click on the "Deploy" button.
Confirm the deployment details and initiate the process.
