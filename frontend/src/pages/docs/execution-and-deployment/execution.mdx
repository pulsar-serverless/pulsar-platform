# Serverless Execution and Deployment

## Introduction

Serverless execution allows you to host and deploy applications without managing traditional servers. This document outlines how to execute and deploy serverless applications on our platform.

## Step 1: Upload Your Application

Start by uploading your web application files through our intuitive dashboard or use our command-line interface (CLI) for advanced deployment options.

## Step 2: Configure Deployment Settings

Customize your deployment settings, including environment variables, build configurations, and runtime options, to ensure your application runs smoothly.

## Step 3: Initiate Deployment

With a single click or command, deploy your application to our serverless infrastructure. Our system handles the rest, from code build to deployment on a highly scalable and reliable environment.

## Step 4: Monitor Deployment Status

Track the progress of your deployment in real-time and receive notifications once your application is live.
